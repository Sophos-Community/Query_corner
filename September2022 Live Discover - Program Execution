| DESCRIPTION                                                                    |
| The query uses several tables associated with a program execution such as:     |
| BAM, Shimcache, Userassist, Prefetch, Shortcuts, and Filesystem tables.        |
| This is a go-to query to quickly identify evidence of a program execution      |
|                                                                                |
